### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because it was the first time coding something
    similar to a game. I learned to write functions and statements that changed
    the execution flow of the program using if statements. The Hi Lo game that
    was coded in this lab was revisited and improved in later labs as well.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because it revisited previous code that
    calculated the hand score of two cards in blackjack. I was curious as to
    how to calculate the hand score of multiple cards in blackjack and this lab
    sought to implement just that. For this part of the lab, my partner and I
    had to write code that dealt with boolean logic, as well as validating
    command line arguments.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was a favorite because it was decently challenging. This lab
    dealt with 2D vectors, which were hard to understand at first, but once my
    partner and I understood how to visualize the vectors it was much easier to
    implement the necessary logic. There was also a problem with quotes inside
    of quotes in our cout message, but the solution to this problem was a
    valuable learning experience.
